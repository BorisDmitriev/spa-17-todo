# To-Do List App
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


### Description:

- Through this To-Do List App, the user should be able to add items to the todo list.
- There's an `input` field where the items are added.
- The user can also delete these items through a `button`.

1. Create a TO-DO List app with an `input` field and a `button` reading **"Create Task"** for adding To-Do's. If you click on the `button`, a To-Do should be added to the list of To-Do's.

2. Add a _Delete_ `button` to each item, to enable the user delete a To-Do from the list.

3. **Optional:** Style to your pleasing.

## Bonus

- Add a `button` to show that the item is complete or done.
- You can add styling to cross-out an item.
